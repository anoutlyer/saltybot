#SaltyBot v1.0 by outlyer
#Used to track data on saltybet characters in order to produce most accurate betting percentages.

The program is console based only right now.
Please unzip the matchups.tar file and keep the matchups folder and mmr file in the same directory of saltybot.exe, or else you'll have to start recording matchups from scratch.
For every matchup the program will tell you key data on both fighters. It will list "Games", "ELO", and "Record".
The stats on the left of the ":" are the red player, blue on the right.
The Games section is how many games the program has recorded for each fighter.
The ELO section is the rating each fighter has been given based on performance. (This is the most important number)
The Record section is the number of wins each fighter has in the matchup. (This is rarely filled in because it's extremely rare for two fighters to have the same matchup twice)
The goal of the program is for the fighter with more ELO to win most of the time, and results become more accurate the longer you record matchups.
